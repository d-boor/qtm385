# Hi, there! üëã <br> Tudo bem? üòÑüáßüá∑ {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last time, we saw that...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- [Regression in R]{.alert}: Covered adding [covariates]{.alert} with `lm_lin()`, [centring]{.alert}, and sub-group analysis with [interaction terms]{.alert} using `lm_robust`.
- [Hypothesis Testing]{.alert}: Covered different types of null hypotheses: sharp null and null hypothesis of no average treatment effect; confidence intervals, type I and type II errors
- Statistical concept of [sampling variability]{.alert}, how it relates to sampling distributions, and how it affects the interpretation of experimental estimates
- [Randomisation Inference]{.alert}: Introduced, with the `ri2` package, which uses the `randomizr` package.
- Demonstrated RI with two examples, including one about [female council heads]{.alert} and the other about [runoff elections]{.alert}.
- [Real Experiment]{.alert}: Analysed a paper using linear regression models as well as Randomisation Inference
:::

## Today, we will...
:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Talk a bit about `R` and the packages we have seen so far
- Discuss the next steps of your pre-analysis plan and the final project
- Discuss three papers 
  - Kalla, J. & D. Broockman. 2016. [Campaign Contributions Facilitate Access to Congressional Officials: A Randomized Field Experiment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12180). American Journal of Political Science, 60(3): 545‚Äì558
  - Chattopadhyay, R., & Duflo, E. (2004). [Women as policy makers: Evidence from a randomized policy experiment in India](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x). Econometrica, 72(5), 1409-1443.

- [But first...]{.alert}, let's talk about your group work

## Group Work ü§ù
### What I have in mind...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now that you have your groups, I'd like you to start working on your pre-analysis plan
- I'll give you some time to discuss your ideas and start writing your plan
- My plan is that you should slowly think about your final project, one step at a time
- What do you think about having two weeks to write the following:
  - Submit at most 2 paragraphs summarising an experiment that you want to develop in this course. At minimum, your summary should include a research question, why the question is important, and a rough sketch of how you plan to answer the question.
- In three weeks:
  - Write a title and abstract for a paper you imagine writing based on your proposed experiment. Assume that your findings align with your theoretical predictions. Remember to establish why the findings matter for your intended audience.
- In four weeks:
  - Outline your pre-analysis plan. Your outline should include sections on the research question, the experimental design, the data you will collect, and the analysis you will conduct.

## What I have in mind...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- In five weeks:
  - Use `Quarto` and `DeclareDesign` to write your report and simulate your experiment
- In six weeks:
  - Revised outline, now including a new section titled "Potential Threats." In this section, diagnose threats and briefly describe potential countermeasures. This new section should discuss false positives, statistical power, demand effects, noncompliance, spillover, and attrition.
- In seven weeks:
  - Revised outline, now included a new section on "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects." In this section, discuss how you might explore heterogeneity in treatment effects. This section should include a discussion of how you might use covariates to explore heterogeneity.
- In eight weeks:
  - I will give you feedback on your outline and provide you with the simulated data for your experiment.
  - You will have two weeks to write your final report.
- Last week of class:
  - You will present your findings to the class.

# R packages üì¶ {background-color="#2d4563"}
### `fabricatr`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- `fabricatr` is a package that helps you simulate data for your experiments
