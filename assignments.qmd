title: Assignments

Here you will find information about the assignments for QTM 385. There are ten of them, each worth 5% of your final grade. The assignments are designed to help you practice the concepts covered in class and to develop your data science skills.

Assignment submissions are typically due on Wednesdays at 11:59pm in the week following their publication. You may submit via Canvas (preferred) or email (<danilo.freire@emory.edu>).

I encourage you to complete assignments in Quarto or Jupyter Notebooks and submit them in html format (just because they are easier to read on Canvas). PDF is also absolutely fine. You can also submit them as a Word document, provided that code and results are included in the same document.

You will find the questions in the `assignments` folder on [the course repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm385/tree/main/assignments). You can also access them through the links below.

When submitting, please name your files as follows: `assignment-01-your-name.pdf`. For instance: `assignment-01-john-doe.pdf`.

## Pre-Analysis Plan

The pre-analysis plan (PAP) is a document that outlines the research design, hypotheses, and analysis plan before the data are collected. It is a very important step in the research process, as it helps to prevent data mining and p-hacking. The PAP will be worth 20% of your final grade. Further instructions will be provided in the coming weeks.

## Final Project

The final project will be a group effort. Detailed instructions will soon be available on the GitHub repository. The project will be worth 30% of your final grade.
