Quarto is a powerful tool that allows you to write in Markdown and convert your document to a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML, and Word. You can use this template to write your PAP in Markdown and then convert it to a PDF for submission.\nFor you to use this template, you need to have R, Pandoc and Quarto installed on your computer. You can install Pandoc by following the instructions on the Pandoc website. To install the Quarto package, run the following command in R:\ninstall.packages(c(\"quarto\", \"rmarkdown\", \"tidyverse\"))\nYou also need to install a distribution on your computer to convert your Markdown document to a PDF. I recommend you install TinyTeX, a lightweight distribution of . You can install TinyTeX by running the following command in R:\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\nFor those who prefer a more comprehensive distribution, you can install MiKTeX on Windows or MacTeX on macOS.\nFinally, you should also install the Libertine and Inconsolata fonts on your computer to use this template. You can download the Libertine font from the Linux Libertine website and the Inconsolata font from the Google Fonts website. However, you can use any other font you prefer by changing the fontfamily and monofont options in the YAML header of this document. More information on how to change the font in your document can be found in the Quarto documentation.\nYou can then use the Quarto package to convert your Markdown document to a PDF. To convert your document to a PDF, run the following command in R:\nquarto::quarto_render(\"pre-analysis-plan.qmd\", output_format = \"pdf\")\nThis command will convert your Markdown document to a PDF and save it in the same directory as your Markdown file."

    "text": "Pre-Analysis Plans (PAPs) are detailed documents that researchers create before collecting or analysing data, outlining their intended research methodology, hypotheses, and analytical approach. These plans have become increasingly important in social and biological sciences as a tool to enhance research transparency, credibility, and reproducibility. PAPs serve as a roadmap for researchers, helping them think through their study design and analysis strategy in advance, while also providing a public record of their intentions.\nThe use of PAPs has grown significantly in recent years, particularly in fields such as economics, political science, and psychology. According to the American Economic Association’s website, as of 2024, the AEA RCT Registry currently lists 8,937 studies with locations in 169 countries1. This trend reflects a growing recognition of the importance of research transparency and the need to address issues such as publication bias and p-hacking."

    "text": "Enhancing Research Transparency\nPAPs provide a clear record of the researcher’s intentions before data collection or analysis, reducing concerns about data mining or selective reporting. By specifying analyses in advance, researchers demonstrate their commitment to transparent and unbiased research practices. This transparency allows other researchers and stakeholders to distinguish between pre-planned analyses and exploratory findings, increasing confidence in the reported results.\nFor example, in a study on the effects of a cash transfer program on educational outcomes, researchers might specify in their PAP that they will analyse the impact on primary school enrollment rates, test scores, and dropout rates. By doing so, they commit to reporting these outcomes regardless of whether the results are statistically significant or align with their hypotheses. This approach prevents the temptation to selectively report only positive or interesting findings after seeing the data."

    "text": "Improving Research Quality\nBy forcing researchers to think through their analysis in advance, PAPs can lead to better-designed studies and more robust analytical approaches. This process often reveals potential issues or oversights that can be addressed before data collection begins. For instance, when drafting a PAP, researchers might realise they need to include additional control variables or consider potential confounding factors they had not initially thought of.\nConsider a medical study examining the effectiveness of a new drug. In developing the PAP, researchers might recognise the need to stratify their sample based on age groups or pre-existing conditions, leading to a more nuanced and informative analysis. They might also identify potential interaction effects between the drug and other medications, prompting them to collect data on participants’ full medical histories."

    "text": "Addressing Publication Bias\nPAPs can help combat publication bias by encouraging the reporting of all pre-specified analyses, regardless of their results. This approach ensures that null or unexpected findings are not selectively omitted from publication. Publication bias is a significant issue in many fields, where studies with positive or novel results are more likely to be published than those with null or negative findings.\nFor example, in psychology, the “file drawer problem” refers to the tendency for studies with non-significant results to remain unpublished. By pre-registering their analyses, researchers commit to reporting all findings, which can help provide a more balanced view of the evidence. In a meta-analysis of psychological interventions, for instance, including pre-registered studies might reveal that the overall effect size is smaller than what would be estimated based solely on published literature."

    "text": "Increasing Credibility\nPre-registering analyses can increase the credibility of research findings, as it demonstrates that the results were not cherry-picked or manipulated to achieve desired outcomes. This is particularly important in fields where research findings can influence policy decisions or clinical practices.\nFor instance, in a study on the effectiveness of a new educational intervention, pre-registering the primary outcome measures (e.g., standardised test scores) and analysis methods prevents researchers from selectively reporting only the most favorable results. If the intervention shows mixed effects – perhaps improving math scores but not reading scores – the PAP ensures that both outcomes are reported, providing a more accurate picture of the intervention’s impact."

    "text": "Facilitating Replication\nDetailed PAPs make it easier for other researchers to replicate studies, as they provide a clear roadmap of the intended analyses and methodologies. Replication is crucial for scientific progress, but it often fails due to insufficient information about the original study’s methods.\nFor example, in a complex econometric analysis of labor market policies, a well-written PAP would specify not only the data sources and variables used but also the exact statistical models, including any transformations or coding of variables. This level of detail allows other researchers to reproduce the analysis, even if they do not have access to the original data, by following the same procedures with similar datasets."

For instance:\nResearch Question: “Does providing microfinance loans to women in rural areas increase their household income and empowerment?”\nHypotheses:\n\nWomen who receive microfinance loans will show a 20% increase in household income after one year compared to the control group.\nLoan recipients will report higher scores on a standardised empowerment index, with an expected effect size of 0.5 standard deviations.\nThe impact of loans on income will be moderated by the recipient’s level of education, with more educated women showing larger income gains."

Schools will be randomly selected from a list of all eligible schools (defined as those with at least 500 students and a 30% or higher free lunch program participation rate). Within each school, we will randomly select 20 students from the 10th grade. Power calculations indicate that this sample size will allow us to detect an effect size of 0.2 standard deviations with 80% power at a 5% significance level, accounting for potential clustering at the school level.”"
